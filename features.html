<div class="features">
Snapshots:Pictures of an evolving tree of files.<br><br><br>
CONCURRENCY:<br>
============<br>
1)Locking<br>
2)Merge befor Commit:<br>Bob "patches up the conflict" with alice before he commits his code ;)....obiviously.<br>
3)Commit before merge:<br>Alice has a copy of the version.<br>

They make separate commits .....and "merge" their code if need be.
